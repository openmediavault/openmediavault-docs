|omv| |version| documentation
=============================

|omv| is a complete network attached storage (NAS) solution based on Debian
Linux.

* It's available for x86 and ARM platforms.
* Features a full Web Administration interface.
* Can be controlled via SSH, if enabled.
* Access to file storage is possible with a variety of different protocols such
  as FTP, SMB/CIFS or NFS and can be controlled with Access Right Management
  for users and groups.

|omv| is primarily designed to be used in home environments or small home
offices, but is not limited to those scenarios. It is a simple and easy to use
out-of-the-box solution that everyone can install and administer without
needing expert level knowledge of Networking and Storage Systems.

The system is built on a modular design and can be easily extended with plugins
available right after installation of the base system. Additional 3rd-party
plugins are available via the `OMV-Extras repository <http://omv-extras.org/>`_.
