`Contributor License Agreement <https://www.openmediavault.org/contributoragreement.html>`_.

Can I submit patches without having signed the CLA?
---------------------------------------------------
    No. All contributors and patch submitters must sign the CLA before they
    submit anything substantial. Trivial patches like spelling fixes or missing
    words won't require an agreement, since anybody could do those. However,
    almost anything will require a CLA.

Contribution rules
------------------
    Code contributions must satisfy the following conditions. Contributions
    that do not fulfill these conditions will not be accepted.

    * The :doc:`coding guidelines <coding_guideline>` must be followed.
