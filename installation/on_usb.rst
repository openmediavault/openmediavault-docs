Installation on USB
###################

|omv| can be installed on an USB flash drive to boot from it.

#. Follow the :doc:`via_iso` and select your USB flash drive as target drive.
#. Enable the `openmediavault-writecache <https://github.com/OpenMediaVault-Plugin-Developers/openmediavault-writecache>`_ plugin.
   This lowers the amount of writes to the USB flash drive, making sure you can enjoy it for a long time.
