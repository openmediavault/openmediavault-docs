At present there are many ways of getting support, many of them are done by the
community. The current support channels are:

We have a support IRC channel at freenode servers, just type ``/join #openmediavault``
in your favourite IRC client, type your question and wait for someone available
to help you.

**Facebook**

**Discord**

Since last year there is also a discord group. You can get access by clicking

.. note::
   Make sure you provide as much information as you can when posting in the forum
   or bugtracker and describing your problem. If you have an error in the |webui|
   make sure you take screenshots of the backtrace, to identify properly what's
   failing.
