Plugins
=======

You can add more features & apps by simply selecting the software you need, we
call this plugins. Plugins are possible due to the modular design of |omv| and
are the preferred way to extend your NAS. While it is still possible to install regular software alongside |omv|, installing instead containerized software build with podman or Docker is highly recommended. This recommendation stems from many issues caused by later version updates that made |omv| or other software unusable due to introducing conflicting component dependencies. Plugins only exist for your
convenience.
